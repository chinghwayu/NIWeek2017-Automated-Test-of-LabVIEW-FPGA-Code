# NIWeek2017 - Automated Test of LabVIEW FPGA Code
FPGA Code and Unit Tests shown at NIWeek 2017

System Requirements
- LabVIEW 2016 or later
- LabVIEW RT
- LabVIEW FPGA
- FlexRIO driver
- AMC package (available via VIPM)

After opening the project, right-click on the FPGA Target and verify the execution code is set to simulation. The Simulation VI Path will be different for your computer. Make sure the Simulation VI Path points to <NIWeek2017-Automated-Test-of-LabVIEW-FPGA-Code>/Digital Pattern Generator/Automation Test/Component Testing/Simulated IO For Digital Pattern Generator.vi
